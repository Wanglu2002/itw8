	<h3>Colors and images</h3>
	<p>
		I chose those images because I have been watching SpongeBob SquarePants recently. This has been my favorite cartoon since I was a child!<br><br>
		Colors I chose is based on pink. I chose them because pink is my favorite color. Especially baby pink. Walls in my room was that color. My dream house is pink!

	</ul>
	<h3>Aside Section</h3>
	<p>
		The aside can represent secondary content outside of an article, that is
        considered secondary to the main content in the article. The aside can
        be cool typography designs, quotes, advertising, etc... The aside can
        also be utlized within an article, although in this instance there
        should be some parallel to the content of the article.<br>
        Although it may look like a sidbar in the sense of a navigational
        widget, it is always wise to use the nav element instead of an aside
        when you would like to place additional navigational elements.
