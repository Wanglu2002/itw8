	<h3>Aside Section</h3>
	<p>
		The aside can represent secondary content outside of an article, that is
        considered secondary to the main content in the article. The aside can
        be cool typography designs, quotes, advertising, etc... The aside can
        also be utlized within an article, although in this instance there
        should be some parallel to the content of the article.<br>
        Although it may look like a sidbar in the sense of a navigational
        widget, it is always wise to use the nav element instead of an aside
        when you would like to place additional navigational elements.
